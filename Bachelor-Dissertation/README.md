Examine how Covid-19 influence social charitable behaviors through a continuous difference-in-differences model.

1- [PCA_severity_index.py](https://github.com/JingwenSHI-Novae/Coding-Samples/blob/main/Bachelor-Dissertation/PCA_severity_index.py): Constructed severity index of Covid-19 in different regions of UK on a daily basis, using PCA method.

2- [coding_severity_index.do](https://github.com/JingwenSHI-Novae/Coding-Samples/blob/main/Bachelor-Dissertation/coding_severity_index.do): Coding for severity index by aggregation and normalization in time seires.

3- [covid_charity.do](https://github.com/JingwenSHI-Novae/Coding-Samples/blob/main/Bachelor-Dissertation/covid_charity.do): Main of the data process and report of results.


Summary of the research:

-	Provided empirical evidence of whether social charitable giving would be affected by pandemics in the context of the Covid-19 and investigated several channels that might take effect using CLRS survey data

-	Constructed regional severity metrics using the PCA method and addressed the country-level endogenous problems in estimating the effect of the Covid-19 shock on peopleâ€™s giving amounts using the continuous difference-in-differences model

-	Conducted heterogeneity analysis especially considering socio-economic classifications, and provided indicative suggestions for charitable policies on post-pandemic redistribution
