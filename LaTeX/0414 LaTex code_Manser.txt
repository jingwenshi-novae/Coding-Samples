\textsf{This proverb means that when there is a change in leadership or authority, there will likely be changes in rules and regul  ations. It implies that those in power have the ability to make and enforce their own laws. The moral implication of this proverb is that people should be aware of the potential for changes in laws and regulations when there is a change in leadership. It also suggests that people should be prepared to adapt to new rules and regulations when necessary. The behavioral implication is that people should be respectful of those in power and follow the laws that they create. The ethical implication is that those in power should use their authority responsibly and create laws that are fair and just for all.}

\textsf{When a new ruler or government comes to power—or when a new person takes control of a situation—changes are made and different rules apply: “‘What’s yer (your) hurry then, Laban?’ inquired Coggan. ‘You used to bide as late as the latest.’ ‘Well, ye (you) see, neighbours, I was lately married to a woman, and she’s my vocation now. . . . ’ The young man halted lamely. ‘New lords new laws, as the saying is, I suppose,’ remarked Coggan” (Thomas Hardy, Far from the Madding Crowd, 1874). The proverb was first recorded in the mid-16th century, but with the implication that it had long been in general use.}

\textsf{This proverb means that when someone is not present to defend themselves or explain their actions, they are often blamed or considered guilty. It implies that people tend to judge others based on incomplete information or hearsay. The moral implication of this proverb is that we should be careful not to jump to conclusions or make assumptions about others without hearing their side of the story. It also suggests that we should give people the benefit of the doubt and not rush to judgment.}

The French saying referred to in this quotation is “Les absents ont toujours tort.” The proverb was first recorded in English in 1640 in the form “The absent party is still faulty.”}

The behavioral implication is that it is important to be responsible with your finances and avoid overspending. The ethical implication is that it is important to pay back any debts you owe, as failing to do so can harm others and damage your reputation.}

It suggests that individuals should rely on themselves rather than expecting help from others. The proverb also implies that people should trust in a higher power, such as God, to provide assistance when needed. The moral implication of this proverb is that self-preservation is important, but it should not come at the expense of others. It is important to strike a balance between taking care of oneself and helping others in need.}

\textsf{At times of crisis or great danger, each must take responsibility for his or her own personal survival and hope for divine protection for everybody: “‘Every man for himself, and God for us all!’ was the cool answer of the refractory seaman” (Captain Marryat, The King’s Own, 1830). The proverb was fi rst recorded in 1546. In the shorter form “Every man for himself” it is of earlier origin, occurring in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales (c. 1390): “Ech (Each) man for himself (himself), ther (there) is noon oother (no other).”}
